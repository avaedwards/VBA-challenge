# VBA-challenge
Bill, the TA helped me with the code of figuring how how to loop from i to the last row of things, rather than a specific number. 
I googled how to structure certain commands, so I could do the syntax corrently, also the TAs answered questions I had about how to approach the assignment, although this did not include any code
Sorry it is so late I had completely forgotten how to put stuff only github, and so setting this up was tricky, I hope that everything is in the correct format I can resubmit it if something doesn't work with the formatting
